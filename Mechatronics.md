# Mechatronics (机电一体化)

## Introduction

Imagine you’re building a robot. To make it work, you don’t just need gears, motors, or circuits; <br>
you need a brain (software), senses (sensors), muscles (motors), and bones (mechanical structure). <br>
That’s essentially what **mechatronics** is all about — combining different engineering skills to <br>
create intelligent systems. <sup>[1]</sup>
