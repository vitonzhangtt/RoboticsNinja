# Control/Motion Control 

## Motion Control Algorithms

Robot control deals with the problem of determining the **forces** and **torques** that <br>
must be developed by the robotic `actuators` in order for the robot to go at the desired <br>
position, track the desired trajectory, and, in general, perform some task with desired <br>
performance requirements. The solution to controlling problems in robotics (fixed and mobile) <br>
is more complicated than usual due to the inertial forces, coupling reaction forces, and <br> 
gravity effects. <sup>[8]</sup>
