# Model Predictive Control

**Model predictive control** (MPC) is an advanced method of process control that <br>
is used to control a process while satisfying a set of constraints.

## Optimization Solvers
Here are several open-source nonlinear optimization solvers that can be used for MPC â€” `ipopt`, `CASADI`, `minlp`.
