# Model Predictive Control

**Model predictive control** (MPC) is an advanced method of process control that <br>
is used to control a process while satisfying a set of constraints.

Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular feedback control methodology where a <br>
finite-horizon **optimal control problem** (OCP) is iteratively solved with an <br>
updated measured state on each iteration. <sup>[2]</sup>

## Optimization Solvers
Here are several open-source nonlinear optimization solvers that can be used for MPC — `ipopt`, `CASADI`, `minlp`.
