# Optimal Control

## What's Optimal Control?

**Optimal control theory** is a branch of **control theory** that deals with finding a control <br> 
for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized. <br>
It has numerous applications in science, engineering and operations research. <sup>[1]</sup>
