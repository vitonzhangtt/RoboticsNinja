# Key Components 


* `Power Supply` - The working power to the robot is provided by batteries, hydraulic(液压), <br>
  solar power(太阳能), or pneumatic(气动) power sources.
* `Actuators` - Actuators(执行器) are the energy conversion device used inside a robot. The major <br> function of actuators is to convert energy into movement.
* `Electric motors (DC/AC)` - Motors are electromechanical component used for converting electrical <br>
  energy into its equivalent mechanical energy. In robots motors are used for providing rotational movement.
* `Sensors` - Sensors provide real time information on the task environment. Robots are equipped with <br> tactile sensor it imitates the mechanical properties of touch receptors of human fingerprints and a vision sensor is used for computing the depth in the environment.
* `Controller` - Controller is a part of robot that coordinates all motion of the mechanical system. It also receives an input from immediate environment through various sensors. The heart of robot's controller is a microprocessor linked with the input/output and monitoring device. The command issued by the controller activates the motion control mechanism, consisting of various controller, actuators and amplifier.
