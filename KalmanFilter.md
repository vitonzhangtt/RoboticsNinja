# Kalman Filter



## Guass-Kalman Process
**Gauss–Markov stochastic processes** (named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov) are stochastic <br>
processes that satisfy the requirements for both **Gaussian processes** and **Markov processes**. <sup>[15]</sup>

## Linear Kalman Filter

They(Kalman Filter) are separated into **predict** (using the model) and **correct** (using the <br>
measurements), hence the two-step process for estimating state. The predict step is <br>
responsible for propagating the state vector into the future using the linear model, <br>
and the correct step blends the current prediction with a current measurement to get the <br> 
corrected estimated state. <sup>[18]</sup>
