# Continuum Robotics (连续体机器人)

CSC 476H5: Introduction to Continuum Robots <br>
Continuum robots differ fundamentally from traditional robots, <br>
as they are jointless structures. Their appearance is evocative <br>
of animals and organs such as trunks, tongues, worms, and snakes. <br>
Composed of flexible, elastic, or soft materials, continuum robots <br>
can perform complex bending motions and appear with curvilinear shapes. <br> 
Continuum robots have a high potential to navigate and operate in <br>
confined spaces currently unreachable to standard robots, as their <br>
diameter to length ratio can be as low as 1:300. Typical applications <br>
are in minimally invasive surgery or in maintenance, repair and operation. <br>
This introductory course covers the fundamentals of continuum robot design, <br>
modelling, planning, and control. Students will code their own continuum <br>
robot simulator. <sup></sup>
