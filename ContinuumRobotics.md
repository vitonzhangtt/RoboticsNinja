`CSC 476H5: Introduction to Continuum Robots
Continuum robots differ fundamentally from traditional robots, 
as they are jointless structures. Their appearance is evocative 
of animals and organs such as trunks, tongues, worms, and snakes. 
Composed of flexible, elastic, or soft materials, continuum robots 
can perform complex bending motions and appear with curvilinear shapes. 
Continuum robots have a high potential to navigate and operate in 
confined spaces currently unreachable to standard robots, as their 
diameter to length ratio can be as low as 1:300. Typical applications 
are in minimally invasive surgery or in maintenance, repair and operation.
This introductory course covers the fundamentals of continuum robot design, 
modelling, planning, and control. Students will code their own continuum 
robot simulator.` <sup></sup>
