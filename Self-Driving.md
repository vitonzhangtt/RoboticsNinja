# Self-Driving

google "self-driving technology"

An `autonomous vehicle` is broadly defined as one equipped with technology that senses the conditions  <br>
around it, including *traffic*, *pedestrians*, and *physical hazards* and can adjust its course and speed <br>
without a human at the controls. The terms “autonomous” and “self driving cars” are often used <br>
interchangeably. <sup>[7]</sup>
